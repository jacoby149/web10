1.0.15 || 16.07.2026
docs: fix D1 consumer list in parallel execution.txt — (C4, D3, D4) → (C4, D4, D5),
matching the sequencing rule "D1 before C4/D4-schemas/D5" (D3 mobile encryptor
has no D1 dependency)
plan: new CROSS-CUTTING docs section — three doc surfaces, three homes:
generated OpenAPI reference ships with the api (invest in annotations, optional
Scalar UI), protocol spec + conventions live in-repo as versioned markdown +
JSON Schema (conformance suite tests against them), docs/ becomes an MkDocs
Material site (embeds OpenAPI, mkdocstrings, sdk typedoc; no hosted SaaS docs)
plan: phase 7 — home/ + docs/ -> marketing-ui/: inc's website + dev docs as ONE
site (docs are part of a saas marketing site), rebuilt on the ui toolchain
(vite + react + bun), own vhost, never in the node compose; stays in the
monorepo by choice (one dev, lean). repo reads api / ui / marketing-ui.
docs site framework lean updated accordingly: js-native (starlight or
docusaurus) instead of mkdocs, since it lives inside marketing-ui.
decisions.md: new D12 recording the api / ui / marketing-ui repo trio.
plan: docs section simplified — split by audience not tool; adds the missing
user/creator guides (they ARE the saas marketing content, written per
milestone as features ship); dev docs = D1 spec + generated references

1.0.14 || 16.07.2026
phase 0 completion — RTC modernization + docker image rebuild + cleanup:
  - rtc service: node:15 → bun, index.js → index.ts with types, npm → bun,
    added tsconfig.json, updated package.json (web10-rtc, ESM, typescript)
  - auth2/Dockerfile: new multi-stage Dockerfile (bun dev target + static deploy)
  - auth/Dockerfile: node:14 → bun (legacy UI, deprecated in phase 2)
  - api/Dockerfile: already modern (uv, python3.12) — no change needed
  - docker-compose.yml: pipenv → uv, npm → bun, nodemon → bun run dev,
    added "ui" service (auth2), legacy auth shifted to port 3001,
    removed version: "3" (deprecated), renamed rtc volume

  - removed docker-compose-lite.yml, docker-compose-nginx.yml, custom.conf
    (one compose file is enough, people can figure out deployment)
  - removed web10-deploy/ (stale GCP configs, skaffold k8s manifests)

1.0.13 || 14.07.2026
phase 0 typescript migration:
  - renamed all 34 .jsx files to .tsx (React) or .ts (non-React)
  - added global.d.ts for Window.I augmentation
  - fixed dynamic object pattern with Record<string, any> type assertions
  - fixed document.getElementById casts to HTMLInputElement
  - fixed .toFixed().toLocaleString() type error
  - updated index.html entry point to main.tsx

1.0.12 || 14.07.2026
phase 0 auth2 toolchain modernization:
  - migrated auth2 from create-react-app to vite 6 + bun (index.html entry,
    src/main.jsx, vite.config.js, bun.lock; removed react-scripts + package-lock.json)
  - react 18 -> 19; renamed all components .js -> .jsx; vitest replaces jest
  - removed react-inject-env + web-vitals; package renamed auth2 -> web10-ui
  - gitignored auth2/dist/ build output

1.0.11 || 14.07.2026
phase 0 python toolchain modernization:
  - switch to uv for package management (pyproject.toml, uv.lock, removed Pipfile + requirements.txt)
  - python 3.12, fastapi 0.139, pydantic v2, PyJWT 2.13, stripe 15, twilio 9, gunicorn 26, uvicorn 0.51
  - pydantic v2 migration: .dict() -> .model_dump(), Optional[X] -> X | None, ConfigDict(extra="allow") on Token model
  - removed infisical dependency (pyinfisical.py, settings.py integration) — env vars only for secrets
  - pruned dead deps: python-ldap, python-gnupg, systematic, future, secrets (pypi)
  - Dockerfile: slim python3.12 image with uv (no pipenv, no nodejs base, no apt libsasl/libldap)
  - added ruff for lint+format (pyproject.toml config, legacy style issues excluded for now)

1.0.10 || 14.07.2026
added plan.txt : phased roadmap (0-12) — toolchain modernization, documentdb/
  ferretdb switch, unified ui + setup wizard, creator admin panel + analytics,
  media/s3 layer, wapi.js + aggregate verb + mcp, killer social app (first-party,
  in-repo) + the lens chatbox, social exporters, user backups, e2e encryption,
  trust & safety. plus cross-cutting quality/testing/security and milestones M0-M3.
added parallel execution.txt : 4-lane plan for running Conductor workspaces in
  parallel without merge conflicts (lane ownership + wave-0 test seatbelt).
added CLAUDE.md, GLOSSARY.md, decisions.md : agent onboarding + shared context.
documented a CONFIRMED federation security bug : providers don't cryptographically
  validate each other (HS256 symmetric signing) — fix is HS256 -> RS256/EdDSA + JWKS.
established five end-to-end security invariants (I1-I5) enforced by the test suite.

1.0.9
added infisical secrets management.
added pipenv for api python package management.
made the settings.py file have defaults.
made configs managed by .env file.
made CORS_SERVICE_MANAGERS from list to comma sep. strings.
made COST dict env var type multiple env vars.
some use case presentations in the sdk folder.

1.0.8 || 11.10.2023
Made the CHANGELOG
Any time there is an improvement / change to the project, that improvement /
change will go here
1.0.8 is the most recent release!
I don't even remember what I improved from 1.0.7.
That is the exact reason why it is beneficial to have a changelog.
